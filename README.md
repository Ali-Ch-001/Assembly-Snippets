# Assembly Snippets

## Description
This repository contains a collection of assembly language snippets and small programs. These examples demonstrate various assembly programming techniques and algorithms, aimed at helping learners understand low-level programming concepts and the architecture of computer systems.

## Features
- Basic assembly language syntax and operations
- Examples of common algorithms implemented in assembly
- Demonstrations of low-level system operations
- Code snippets for different assembly instructions and techniques

## Requirements
- An assembler (e.g., NASM, MASM)
- A compatible compiler (e.g., GCC for linking NASM code)
- An emulator or virtual machine for running and testing assembly code (optional)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Ch-001/Assembly-Snippets.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Assembly-Snippets
   ```

## Usage
1. Choose the desired assembly snippet or program from the repository.
2. Assemble the code using your preferred assembler. For example, with NASM:
   ```bash
   nasm -f elf64 filename.asm -o filename.com
   ```
3. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./filename.com
   ```

### Example
To assemble, link, and run a snippet named `example.asm` using NASM and GCC:
```bash
nasm -f elf64 example.asm -o example.com
./example.com
```

## Snippets
The repository includes the following snippets:
- **Hello World**: A simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **Factorial**: Calculates the factorial of a number.
- **Fibonacci**: Generates Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term.
- **Array Operations**: Demonstrates basic operations on arrays.
- **System Calls**: Examples of making system calls in assembly.

Each snippet is contained in its own file with comments explaining the code.
